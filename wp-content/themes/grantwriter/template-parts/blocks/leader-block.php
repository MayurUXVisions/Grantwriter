                <p>“I love writing grants and am passionate about the amazing impact GrantWriters has on so many communities. I have successfully written grants for 30 years and have served both startup nonprofits and large institutions. I have an impeccable award rate with a hundred million dollars (+) in grant wins.</p>
                <p>I am one of just a few experts in the US who can guide you through each element of, what is referred to as:  Full Lifecycle Grantsmanship. This refers to the mastery of every step in the pre-award, post award, grant implementation, grant compliance, closeout, and sustainability process.</p>
                <p>I know, first hand, how an awarded grant can unleash endless possibilities. I've managed and closed out numerous multi-million dollar, highly complex grants; and I've worked to sustain and expand programs well beyond an initial grant investment. My expertise means long-term, perpetual capacity building is not only possible, it is expected.”</p>
