					<h2>Industry Pioneers with <strong>Big Hearts</strong></h2>
					<p>GrantWriters pioneered the industry of grant writing in 1995. Since our humble beginnings in a small, destitute, border town of the Navajo Nation, we’ve become the largest US employer of professional grant writers and are known as America’s top authority on “everything grants.”</p>

				<h5>Our mission is your grant award success...</h5>
				<p>GrantWriters’ organizational purpose is to connect community agencies with relevant, accessible, award-winning grants through our quality affordable services. We don’t waste time with small, risky grants or those with a limited history of success. Rather, we target high-yield grants we know our clients can competitively win. Big awards, capacity growth, and the sustainability of each and every client are why we are here. </p>
				<p>We are deadline-friendly advocates, willing to work around the clock if it means an award-worthy grant could bring positive change to client communities. Despite the fast-paced nature of grant writing, our proposal quality is not a problem. This is because our writers are industry experts with an average of 25 years of grant experience. As professionals, we know deadlines, planning, forms, budgets, and partner documentation are all a part of our job. We strive to work efficiently to reduce these common stressors on our clients. Regardless of deadline, these all must be properly developed with a “can do”, “ready-to-win” attitude. </p>
				<p>GrantWriters is not a profit-driven organization. Rather, our success is defined by the value we contribute to community betterment. We believe grants have the power to solve most community and social challenges. Grants can right societal wrongs in so many ways. </p>
				<p>We proved this by founding our own nonprofit in 2010, serving the poorest, most underserved tribal community in the United States. With $30 million in grants raised in a few short years, GrantWriters’ funding helped build a mass public transportation system, a community health and wellness center, summer jobs corps, a mass teenage pregnancy prevention initiative resulting in the 75% reduction in teen pregnancy, and so much more. </p>
				<p>GrantWriters’ value and dependability can be verified by the thousands of clients served as well as our close partnerships with GranteeSupport, the National Association of Grant Writers, and other worthy accreditation authorities. We hope to closely partner with you, as well, through the exciting capacity-building journey to come.</p>
